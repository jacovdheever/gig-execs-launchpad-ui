## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `migrations/001_staff_system.sql`
3. Run the migration
4. Verify tables exist

### Step 2: Create First Super User

1. Create auth user in Supabase Dashboard
2. Insert staff_users record linking to that auth user:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO staff_users (user_id, first_name, last_name, role, is_active)
   VALUES ('<auth_user_id>', 'Your', 'Name', 'super_user', true);
   ```

### Step 3: Test Login

1. Navigate to `/staff/login`
2. Login with super user credentials
3. Verify dashboard loads with metrics
4. Test quick action buttons

### Step 4: Deploy to Netlify

Already deployed to `develop` branch - changes will be live after Netlify build completes.

## Key Learnings & Solutions (January 2025)

### **RLS Permission Patterns**

**Problem**: Staff members couldn't update their own profile information without super_user role.

**Solution**: Implemented granular permission checks in `staff-update-user.js`:
- Regular staff can update their own `first_name` and `last_name` fields
- Super users can update any staff member's all fields (including `role` and `is_active`)
- Explicit validation prevents staff from modifying their own role or active status

**Key Pattern**: Always verify requester's role and target record ownership before allowing updates.

### **Select Component Empty String Issue**

**Problem**: shadcn/ui Select component throws error: "A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string."

**Solution**: Use placeholder value like `"all"` and convert in handlers:
```typescript
value={filters.staffId || 'all'}
onValueChange={(value) => handleFilterChange('staffId', value === 'all' ? '' : value)}
```

**Key Pattern**: Never use empty strings as Select.Item values - use meaningful placeholder values.

### **Password Security Standards Consistency**

**Problem**: Staff password change only required 6 characters, inconsistent with client/professional standards.

**Solution**: Implemented unified `validatePassword()` function matching reset-password page:
- Minimum 8 characters
- One uppercase letter
- One lowercase letter
- One number
- Visual checklist for real-time feedback

**Key Pattern**: Maintain consistent password requirements across all user types for security and UX.

### **Client-Side vs Server-Side Filtering**

**Decision**: Use client-side filtering/pagination for audit logs (< 10k records expected).

**Rationale**: Better UX with instant filtering, no loading states, simpler implementation.

**Consideration**: For larger datasets (> 10k), consider server-side filtering with pagination.

## Known Issues

None at this time. All reported issues have been resolved.

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Supabase Auth + staff_users table?

**Pros**:
- Reuses existing authentication infrastructure
- Leverages Supabase's security features
- Simple to implement and maintain
- Uses proven JWT pattern
- Easy to extend with custom claims

**Cons**:
- Staff users appear in same auth.users table as regular users
- Need additional staff_users table for role management

**Decision**: Benefits outweigh the minor complexity of managing the staff_users table.

### Why HTTP-only cookies for impersonation?

**Pros**:
- Cannot be accessed by JavaScript (XSS protection)
- Automatically sent with requests
- Secure and SameSite flags prevent attacks
- Standard pattern for sensitive sessions

**Cons**:
- Requires Netlify functions to read cookie
- Limited flexibility compared to localStorage

**Decision**: Security is paramount for impersonation feature.

### Why hierarchical roles?

**Pros**:
- Simple to understand and implement
- Clear permission model
- Easy to extend with new roles
- Super user can do everything

**Cons**:
- Less flexible than capability-based permissions
- Cannot have admin with specific capabilities

**Decision**: Simplicity wins for MVP. Can extend later if needed.
