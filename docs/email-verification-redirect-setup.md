# Email Verification Redirect Setup

## Issue Fixed
Previously, after email verification, users were redirected to `gigexecs.com/#` which was not helpful. Now users will be redirected to `/auth/callback` with a success message before being taken to the login page.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Registration Flow
- **File**: `src/app/auth/register.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `emailRedirectTo: ${window.location.origin}/auth/callback` to the signUp options
- **Result**: New user registrations will redirect to the callback page after email verification

### 2. Updated Email Change Flow
- **File**: `src/routes/settings/SettingsPage.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `emailRedirectTo: ${window.location.origin}/auth/callback` to the updateUser options
- **Result**: Email changes will redirect to the callback page after verification

### 3. Existing Callback Handler
- **File**: `src/app/auth/callback.tsx`
- **Status**: Already exists and handles email verification properly
- **Features**:
  - Shows success message: "Your email has been verified successfully!"
  - Automatically redirects to login page after 3 seconds
  - Handles error cases with appropriate messages

## Supabase Dashboard Configuration Required

You need to add the callback URL to your Supabase Auth settings:

### Steps:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication → URL Configuration
3. Add these URLs to "Redirect URLs":
   - `https://gigexecs.com/auth/callback`
   - `https://www.gigexecs.com/auth/callback`
   - `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback` (for local development)

### Current Redirect URLs should include:
- `https://gigexecs.com/auth/callback` ✅
- `https://www.gigexecs.com/auth/callback` ✅
- `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback` ✅ (for development)

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Problematic):
1. User registers → receives email
2. User clicks verification link → redirected to `gigexecs.com/#`
3. User is confused and doesn't know what to do

### After (Improved):
1. User registers → receives email
2. User clicks verification link → redirected to `/auth/callback`
3. User sees success message: "Your email has been verified successfully! You can now sign in to your account."
4. User is automatically redirected to login page after 3 seconds
5. User can immediately log in with their credentials

## Testing

### Test Registration Flow:
1. Register a new user
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click the verification link
4. Verify you're redirected to `/auth/callback` with success message
5. Verify automatic redirect to login page after 3 seconds

### Test Email Change Flow:
1. Log in to an existing account
2. Go to Settings → Change Email
3. Enter new email address
4. Check new email for verification link
5. Click the verification link
6. Verify you're redirected to `/auth/callback` with success message

## Benefits

1. **Clear User Feedback**: Users know their email has been verified
2. **Smooth Flow**: Automatic redirect to login page
3. **Professional UX**: No more confusing `/#` redirects
4. **Consistent Experience**: Same flow for registration and email changes
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages if verification fails

## Files Modified

- `src/app/auth/register.tsx` - Added emailRedirectTo option
- `src/routes/settings/SettingsPage.tsx` - Added emailRedirectTo option
- `src/app/auth/callback.tsx` - Already existed, no changes needed

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to production
2. Update Supabase Auth redirect URLs in dashboard
3. Test the complete flow in both development and production
4. Monitor for any issues with the new redirect flow
